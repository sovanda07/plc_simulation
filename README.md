## About

PLCMON is a full-stack industrial automation dashboard built to bridge software engineering and factory-floor monitoring. It simulates a small plant with three PLC-controlled machines and gives operators a real HMI/SCADA-style interface to monitor them: live status, sensor readings, alarms, production counts, and historical trends, all updating in real time over WebSockets.

The project was built as a hands-on way to combine a typical full-stack web app (React, Express, MongoDB, JWT auth) with the kind of data and workflows used in industrial control systems. The PLC layer is currently a simulator that generates realistic sensor data every second, but the backend is structured so that layer can be swapped for a real Modbus TCP or OPC UA connection without touching the rest of the stack.

It also reflects how the project was actually built: iteratively, with authentication and RBAC first, then live data, then each dashboard page, then containerization with Docker.

## Features

- **Authentication** — JWT-based login, registration, and password reset, with Admin and Operator roles
- **Live dashboard** — plant-wide KPIs and per-machine status cards updating every second
- **Real-time monitor** — large-format live readouts for temperature, speed, and current per machine
- **Alarm management** — searchable, filterable alarm log with acknowledge workflow
- **Historical data** — line charts of temperature, speed, current, energy, and production count
- **User management** — admin-only CRUD for user accounts with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **PLC simulator** — generates realistic sensor data every second to stand in for a real PLC, designed to be swapped for a real Modbus TCP / OPC UA connection later

```

Dashboard pages are nested routes under `/dashboard` rendered through a shared layout (`Dashboard.jsx`) using React Router's `<Outlet />`, so each page has its own URL (`/dashboard/alarms`, `/dashboard/historical`, etc.) and survives a page refresh.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB Atlas connection string (or local MongoDB instance)

### Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

Seed the database with the three demo machines:
```bash
npm run seed
```

Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Demo credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | admin@example.com | admin123 |
| Operator | operator@example.com | op123 |

*(Register your own users via the Register page, or seed them directly in MongoDB.)*

---

## Running with Docker

The whole stack (backend + frontend) can also run via Docker Compose. MongoDB stays on Atlas (cloud), so only the connection string is needed in `backend/.env`.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This builds and starts:
- **backend** — Node.js/Express API + Socket.io on port `5000`
- **frontend** — production React build served by Nginx on port `5173`

The app is available at `http://localhost:5173`. Nginx is configured with a SPA fallback (`try_files ... /index.html`) so React Router routes survive a direct refresh.
